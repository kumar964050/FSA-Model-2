# MERN Demo Application

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack demo application.

## Setting Up and Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/kumar964050/FSA-Model-2.git
   ```

## Project Structure

- `client`: Contains the React.js application built with Vite
- `server`: Houses the Node.js application with server-side logic.
- `package.json`: Root-level package.json file for managing project dependencies and scripts.

## Scripts
- `start`: Start the Node.js server using node app.js.
- `build`: Install dependencies, navigate to the client directory, install dependencies there, and then build the React.js application using npm run build in the public directory.
- `dev`: Concurrently run the Node.js server with nodemon and the React.js development server in the public directory using npm run dev.
